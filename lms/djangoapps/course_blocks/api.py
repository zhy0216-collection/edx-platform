    """
    A higher order function implemented on top of the
    block_structure.get_blocks function returning a transformed block
    structure for the given user starting at root_block_usage_key.

    Note: The current implementation requires the root_block_usage_key
    to be the root block of its corresponding course. However, this
    is a short-term limitation, which will be addressed in a coming
    ticket (https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/MA-1604). Once that
    ticket is implemented, callers will be able to get course blocks
    starting at any arbitrary location within a block structure.

    Arguments:
        user (django.contrib.auth.models.User) - User object for
            which the block structure is to be transformed.

        root_block_usage_key (UsageKey) - The usage_key for the root
            of the block structure that is being accessed.

        transformers (BlockStructureTransformers) - A collection of
            transformers whose transform methods are to be called.
            If None, COURSE_BLOCK_ACCESS_TRANSFORMERS is used.

    Returns:
        BlockStructureBlockData - A transformed block structure,
            starting at root_block_usage_key, that has undergone the
            transform methods for the given user and the course
            associated with the block structure.  If using the default
            transformers, the transformed block structure will be
            exactly equivalent to the blocks that the given user has
            access.
